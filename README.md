# Data Warehouse With Amazon Redshift

### Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

### Project Dataset
There are two datasets that reside in S3:

- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

#### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
#### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

### Project Files

1. `create_tables.py`: Creating the fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
2. `etl.py`: Is where will load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
3. `sql_queries.py`: Contains all sql queries, and is imported into the two files above.
4. `dwh.cfg`: Conatians Redshift database and IAM Role info.
6. `README.md`: provides discussion on the project.

### Database Schema Design

#### Fact Table:
1. ***songplays***: records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
        -songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
        
#### Dimension Tables
1. ***users*** - users in the app
        -user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
2. ***songs*** - songs in music database
        -song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
3. ***artists*** - artists in music database
        -artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
4. ***time*** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
        -start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

### ETL pipeline

The ETL Pipeline consists of 2 steps:
1. Load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Execute SQL statements in `sql_queries.py` that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

First, I will extract data from S3 and staging them in Redshift using `COPY` Command. The staging tables are: `staging_event` & `staging_song` .
Then transform data into a set of dimensional tables and fact table with Star Schema.

1. Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Test by running `etl.py` after running `create_tables.py` and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
4. Delete the redshift cluster when finished.



### How to run the Python Scripts

#### To create tables
1. Run `create_tables.py` to create your database and tables.
  ``` python create_tables.py```
  
#### To run ETL pipeline
2. Run `etl.py`, Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running `etl.py` to reset your tables.
  ``` python etl.py```
